Description=restic remote prune on %i weekly

###
# Fire every week on saturday at 04:00 oclock with a random delay of up to
# three hours. There should be no overlapping anymore with running backups at
# that time.
# Latest possible time a backup could start is at 03:00:00, and it would have
# to run more than one hour (pretty unlikely to happen with a non-initial
# backup) to produce an overlap with a prune operation starting with zero
# seconds delay.
